 Number Guessing Game (Python)

This project is a simple **Number Guessing Game** that I created while learning Python. It helped me practice basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input, and random number generation.

##  What I Learned

While building this project, I practiced and understood:

* How to generate random numbers
* Taking user input
* Using `while` loops
* Applying `if-elif-else` conditions
* Counting attempts using variables
* Handling invalid input safely

---

## 🚀 How the Game Works

* The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
* The player tries to guess the number.
* If the guess is too high → it shows **"Lower number please"**
* If the guess is too low → it shows **"Higher number please"**
* When guessed correctly → it shows total attempts used.

##  Purpose of This Project

This project is part of my **Python learning journey** and was built for practice to strengthen my programming fundamentals.

##  Future Improvements

I plan to improve this project by adding:

* Difficulty levels
* Limited attempts mode
* Score system
* GUI version
